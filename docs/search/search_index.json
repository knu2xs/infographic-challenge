Original Design Infographics can be created completely from scratch, and this category is all about a completely new Infographic started from a clean slate - completely from scratch. BYOD Infographics commonly use demographc data included with Business Analyst, but with the ability to add your own data, Infographics can describe any data configured to work with them. This category is for Infographics created using your own data to communicate information from this data. Wowza This is category is for the designers out there. Show us what is possible with color, balance and overall aesthetic. While the Infographic still has to fulfil the purpose, informing with data, this category is all about doing this with the most innovative and creative aesthetic possible. Getting Started We will create accounts for all participants in an ArcGIS Online organization for this event. Prior to the start, you are encouraged to utilize the list of resources to study up, and get better versed in the use and creation of Infographics. Additionally, during the competition, the Business Analyst Development team will make ourselves availabl for office hours, but also please feel free to reach out to us if you have questions as well.
