![Esri Logo](img/esri_globe.png)

Esri, as the leading GIS software company in the world, has attracted arguably the best geographic talent in the world for over a half century, _you_. Please apply your talents to show us what is possible with our technology, Esri Infographics, in the Esri Infographic Challenge.

## Esri Infographics and You

Map makers select features to include and decide how to depict these features utilizing cartographic design concepts to depict information in maps. In this way, maps very well are the original infographic. Both maps and infographics, if done correctly, provide a means, "[to separate the signal from the noise](https://saintanselmhistory.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/the-map-as-the-original-infographic/)," depicting relevant information from data. 

Many of the most talented cartographic and spatial analytic minds are at Esri. Combining these skills with the power of Esri Infographics provdies a means to communicate the results of complex geographic analyses succicently. We are interested in seeing what you will create with _your talents_ and Esri Infographics.

### Why Are We Doing This?

Learning from _you_ is why we are hosting the Esri Infographic Challenge. We are interested in being surprised by what you create, and learning from you as a result. Also, we are interested in what frustrations you encounter, what works, and even more importantly _what does not_. 

We have put a lot of work into Infographics, but we want to make them even better. Consequently, we are interested in hearing about challenges you encounter along with any functional gaps or deficiencies you discover.

## Evaluation Criteria

Essential for all categories is effectively communicating information relevant to understanding an issue or problem. As part of this, we are going to be looking for originality and creativity in design using Esri Infographics for communicating information derived from the data. 

### Originality

"[The power of independent thought or constructive imagination](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/originality)," originality is something new and fresh, something we have not seen before.

### Creativity

The act of surpassing conventional limits. Creativity will be evaluated assessing the degree you have exceeded what is normally done with Esri Infographics.

### Design

Design will be assessed by evaluating the degree you acheive your stated purspose by appling [design principles](https://www.toptal.com/designers/gui/principles-of-design-infographic) to create a visually appealing and functional Esri Infographic.

## Categories

In addition to the best in class, there are also three categories focusing on specific topics as well. Your submission will automatically be entered into the overall Valedictorian category, but you may also submit it for any of the other three categories if they are applicable.

### Valedictorian

This is the overall winner, the head of the class. Below, we are breaking out the categories to focus on specific areas, we have to have one category for the overall winner, the head of the class, the _Valedictorian_.

### Original Design

Infographics can be created completely from scratch, and this category is all about a completely new Infographic started from a clean slate - completely from scratch.

### BYOD

Infographics commonly use demographc data included with Business Analyst, but with the ability to add your own data, Infographics can describe any data configured to work with them. This category is for Infographics created using your own data to communicate information from this data.

### Wowza

This is category is for the designers out there. Show us what is possible with color, balance and overall aesthetic. While the Infographic still has to fulfil the purpose, informing with data, this category is all about doing this with the most innovative and creative aesthetic possible.

## Getting Started

We will create accounts for all participants in an ArcGIS Online organization for this event. Prior to the start, you are encouraged to utilize the list of [resources](resources.md) to study up, and get better versed in the use and creation of Infographics. Additionally, during the competition, the Business Analyst Development team will make ourselves availabl for office hours, but also please feel free to reach out to us if you have questions as well.
